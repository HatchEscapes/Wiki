## Shut Down/ Power on Procedures.

### Audio

The Audio Interface and Amplifier live in the control room. When powering off Always Turn the Amplifiers Off First and then the Audio Interfaces. 

The Boxes on top (Focusrite) are the Audio Interfaces and the 2 Boxes Just below are the Amplifiers (Pyle)

When powering the sound on you do the oposite. Power the Audio Interface First then turn on the Amplifer.  
You can remember this by understanding that the amplifer always wants to have an Audio interface to talk to so it should never be powered on without an Audio Interface. 


### Lights

#### Touch Designer

In Touch Designer.  Navigate to Project 1  -> Lights (Direct Tab should be selected on top)

To turn the lights off slide all the sliders to the left.

The Bathroom handles lights a little differently. Set all of the Text fields to 0. 


##### Trouble shooting: I'm moving the sliders but the lights are not turning off.
